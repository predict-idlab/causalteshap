> *causalteshap* is a **treatment effect analysis** method that uses statistical hypothesis testing on **Shapley values** to find predictive and prognostic features.  

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

UNDER CONSTRUCTION
| [**pip**](https://pypi.org/project/causalteshap/) | `pip install causalteshap` | 
| ---| ----|

## Usage üõ†

*causalteshap* is built to be intuitive, it supports various tree-based models for its S-learner for classification and regression tasks.  
<!-- It is also implemented as sklearn `Transformer` component, allowing convenient integration in `sklearn` pipelines. -->

```py
from causalteshap.causalteshap import CausalteShap
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier

X, T, y = ...  # your classification dataset with treatment T

causalteshap_object = CausalteShap(
    model=CatBoostClassifier(n_estimators=250, verbose=0, use_best_model=True,cat_features=["T"], meta_learner="S")
)

causalteshap_object.fit(X, T, y)  # Fit the PowerShap feature selector
causalteshap_object.get_analysis_df()  # Reduce the dataset to the selected features

```

## Features ‚ú®

* default mode
* `scikit-learn` compatible
* supports various models
* Works for S-learners
* insights into the meta-learners features
